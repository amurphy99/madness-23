# Andrew Murphy - madness-23

For Kaggle's March Madness 2023 Machine Learning Mania competition, using AI and machine learning to forecast outcomes of the 2023 Men’s and Women’s March Madness Tournaments.

For my submissions, I developed one model using my own neural network and learning models entirely from scratch, and another one using the prebuilt neural network from Keras. I was able to use my custom model even as it grew in size and complexity, thanks to the good enough speed provided by Numpy arrays and matrix multiplication. However, when I needed to explore deeper into feature engineering and test different configurations of the neural network, my custom code became too slow to be practical. As a result, I switched to using a basic Keras neural network for my second submission.
